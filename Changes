2004-09-16 0.3 Integrate changes from Matt Lawrence

Matt Lawrence sent me the version of Regexp::Iterator 
that he'd been workign on. This integrates all his ideas.

2004-08-22 0.2 Doh!

Didn't put Build.PL and Makefile.PL in the MANIFEST.
How stupid is that?

2004-08-21 0.1 Initial release

Based on work for URI::Find::Iterator.
Many thanks to Matt Lawrence
